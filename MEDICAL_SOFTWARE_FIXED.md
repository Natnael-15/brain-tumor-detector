## 🎯 Critical Issue Identified and Fixed

### Issue: CORS Configuration Blocking Frontend-Backend Communication

**Symptom**: 
- Frontend could upload files but analysis failed with `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
- Console error: `Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/analysis/upload' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Root Cause**:
The backend CORS middleware was configured to only allow `localhost:3000`, but the frontend was running on port `3001` (because port 3000 was already in use).

**Solution**:
Updated `backend/main.py` CORS configuration to include both ports:
```python
allow_origins=[
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:3001",  # ✅ ADDED
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3001",  # ✅ ADDED
    # ... other origins
]
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Medical image upload and analysis now works correctly
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication established
- ✅ Dashboard shows live progress from 0% to 100%
- ✅ Analysis results displayed with clinical accuracy
